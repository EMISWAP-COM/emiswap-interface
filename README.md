## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Run

```bash
yarn start
```

### Configuring the environment (optional)

To have the interface default to a different network when a wallet is not connected:

1. Make a copy of `.env` named `.env.local`
2. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID` to `"{YOUR_NETWORK_ID}"`
3. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to e.g.
   `"https://{YOUR_NETWORK_ID}.infura.io/v3/{YOUR_INFURA_KEY}"`

Note that the interface only works on main net where all contracts are deployed. The interface will
not work on other networks.
